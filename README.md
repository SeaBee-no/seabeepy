# seabeepy

A collection of useful Python functions for common SeaBee workflows. A bit of a random mixture at present, but will be tidied up as the workflow evolves.

The package is primarily designed to be used on the SeaBee JupyterHub, but it can be installed locally, if you wish.

## Local install

`seabeepy` requires `gdal`, which must be installed and configured separately. It can then be installed using `pip`. The easiest way to install `gdal` is using Anaconda/Mamba:

    mamba create --name seabee python=3.10 gdal
    mamba activate seabee
    pip install git+https://github.com/SeaBee-no/seabeepy.git
    
Note that `seabeepy` has been developed and tested on Linux and may not work as expected on Windows.

## Metadata

Parts of the metadata package can be autogenerated using the following commands

```bash
# Geographic MetaData iso 19139
xsdata https://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd/gmd.xsd --package seabeepy.metadata.gmd --config xsdata.xml
