    "## 2. Optimising files for display online\n",
    "\n",
    "The blog post [here](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2015/02/geotiff-compression-for-dummies.html) from Paul Ramsey provides a useful starting point for optimising GeoTiffs. Note that, for very large files, the [GeoServer documentation](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/tutorials/imagepyramid/imagepyramid.html) recommends building **external image pyramids** rather than **internal overview layers**. Some example bash scripts for building external pyramids are [here](https://www.ianturton.com/tutorials/bluemarble.html). However, I think the GeoServer documentation is out-of-date and loading COGs with internal overviews is easier to automate via the Python API, so we'll test this first.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Using `JPEG` compression will achieve the maximum reduction in file size. This is OK for visualisation online (e.g. for displaying datasets in GeoNode), but the resulting files **must not be used for machine learning**. JPEG compression is lossy and the JPEG format: (i) only supports 8-bit data (i.e. other bit depths must be converted), and (ii) only supports three bands (i.e. it's no good for multi- or hyper-spectral data). JPEG compression can also produce \"artifacts\" in NoData areas of the original image (typically at the edges), which can be distracting and skew the colour scheme. This is due to the JPEG algorithm compressing NoData (often stored as `[0, 0, 0]` in 8-bit images) as e.g. `[2, 1, 4]`, which will display as black (see e.g. [here](https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/114453/2131)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the ML we should always work with the original resolution files, saved with `LZW` compression**, which is lossless. Nevertheless, using `JPEG` compression for visualisation substantially reduces file sizes, giving a smoother user experience."
