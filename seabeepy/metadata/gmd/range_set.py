    Its content model is given by gml:RangeSetType. This content model
    supports a structural description of the range.  The semantic
    information describing the range set is embedded using a uniform
    method, as part of the explicit values, or as a template value
    accompanying the representation using gml:DataBlock and gml:File.
    The values from each component (or “band”) in the range may be
    encoded within a gml:ValueArray element or a concrete member of the
    gml:AbstractScalarValueList substitution group . Use of these
    elements satisfies the value-type homogeneity requirement.
