class File(FileType):
    """for efficiency reasons, GML also provides a means of encoding the range
    set in an arbitrary external encoding, such as a binary file.

    This encoding may be “well-known” but this is not required. This
    mode uses the gml:File element. The values of the coverage
    (attribute values in the range set) are transmitted in a external
    file that is referenced from the XML structure described by
    gml:FileType.  The external file is referenced by the
    gml:fileReference property that is an anyURI (the gml:fileName
    property has been deprecated).  This means that the external file
    may be located remotely from the referencing GML instance. The
    gml:compression property points to a definition of a compression
    algorithm through an anyURI.  This may be a retrievable, computable
    definition or simply a reference to an unambiguous name for the
    compression method. The gml:mimeType property points to a definition
    of the file mime type. The gml:fileStructure property is defined by
    the gml:FileValueModelType.  This is simple enumerated type
    restriction on string.  The only value supported in GML is “Record
    Interleaved”.  Additional values may be supported in future releases
    of GML.  Note further that all values shall be enclosed in a single
    file. Multi-file structures for values are not supported in GML. The
    semantics of the range set is described as above using the
    gml:rangeParameters property. Note that if any compression algorithm
    is applied, the structure above applies only to the pre-compression
    or post-decompression structure of the file. Note that the fields
    within a record match the gml:valueComponents of the
    gml:CompositeValue in document order.
