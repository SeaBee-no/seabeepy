    """In a gml:MultiCurveCoverage the domain is partioned into a collection of
    curves comprising a gml:MultiCurve.  The coverage function then maps each
    curve in the collection to a value in the range set. The content model is
    derived by restriction from gml:AbstractDiscreteCoverageType. Note that the
    restriction replaces the generic gml:domainSet by the specific
    gml:multiCurveDomain whose value is a gml:MultiCurve. In a
    gml:MultiCurveCoverage the mapping from the domain to the range is
    straightforward.

    -       For gml:DataBlock encodings the curves of the gml:MultiCurve are mapped in document order to the tuples of the data block.
    -       For gml:CompositeValue encodings the curves of the gml:MultiCurve are mapped to the members of the composite value in document order.
    -       For gml:File encodings the curves of the gml:MultiCurve are mapped to the records of the file in sequential order.
