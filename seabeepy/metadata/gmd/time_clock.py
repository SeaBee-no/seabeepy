    -       gml:referenceEvent is the name or description of an event, such as solar noon or sunrise, which fixes the position of the base scale of the clock.
    -       gml:referenceTime specifies the time of day associated with the reference event expressed as a time of day in the given clock. The reference time is usually the origin of the clock scale.
    -       gml:utcReference specifies the 24 hour local or UTC time that corresponds to the reference time.
    -       gml:dateBasis contains or references the calendars that use this clock.
