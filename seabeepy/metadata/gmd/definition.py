    the definition if this can be captured in a simple text string, or
    the gml:descriptionReference property element may carry a link to a
    description elsewhere. The gml:identifier element shall provide one
    identifier identifying this definition. The identifier shall be
    unique within the dictionaries using this definition. The gml:name
    elements shall provide zero or more terms and synonyms for which
    this is the definition. The gml:remarks element shall be used to
    hold additional textual information that is not conceptually part of
    the definition but is useful in understanding the definition.
