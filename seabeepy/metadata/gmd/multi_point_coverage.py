    """In a gml:MultiPointCoverage the domain set is a gml:MultiPoint, that is
    a collection of arbitrarily distributed geometric points. The content model
    is derived by restriction from gml:AbstractDiscreteCoverageType. Note that
    the restriction replaces the generic gml:domainSet by the specific
    gml:multiPointDomain whose value is a gml:MultiPoint. In a
    gml:MultiPointCoverage the mapping from the domain to the range is
    straightforward.

    -       For gml:DataBlock encodings the points of the gml:MultiPoint are mapped in document order to the tuples of the data block.
    -       For gml:CompositeValue encodings the points of the gml:MultiPoint are mapped to the members of the composite value in document order.
    -       For gml:File encodings the points of the gml:MultiPoint are mapped to the records of the file in sequential order.
