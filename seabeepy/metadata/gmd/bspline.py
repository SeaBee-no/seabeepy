    used for interpolation in this spline. knot shall be the sequence of
    distinct knots used to define the spline basis functions (see ISO

    “true” if this is a polynomial spline (see ISO 19107:2003,
    6.4.30.5). The attribute knotType shall provide the type of knot
    distribution used in defining this spline (see ISO 19107:2003,

    encoding of curve segments.
