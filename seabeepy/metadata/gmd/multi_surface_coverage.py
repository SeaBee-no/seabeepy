    """In a gml:MultiSurfaceCoverage the domain is partioned into a collection
    of surfaces comprising a gml:MultiSurface.  The coverage function than maps
    each surface in the collection to a value in the range set. The content
    model is derived by restriction from gml:AbstractDiscreteCoverageType. Note
    that the restriction replaces the generic gml:domainSet by the specific
    gml:multiSurfaceDomain whose value is a gml:MultiSurface. In a
    gml:MultiSurfaceCoverage the mapping from the domain to the range is
    straightforward.

    -       For gml:DataBlock encodings the surfaces of the gml:MultiSurface are mapped in document order to the tuples of the data block.
    -       For gml:CompositeValue encodings the surfaces of the gml:MultiSurface are mapped to the members of the composite value in document order.
    -       For gml:File encodings the surfaces of the gml:MultiSurface are mapped to the records of the file in sequential order.
