    between the grid coordinates and the coordinates of an external coordinate
    reference system.

    It is defined by specifying the position (in some geometric space)
    of the grid “origin” and of the vectors that specify the post
    locations. Note that the grid limits (post indexes) and axis name
    properties are inherited from gml:GridType and that
    gml:RectifiedGrid adds a gml:origin property (contains or references
    a gml:Point) and a set of gml:offsetVector properties.
