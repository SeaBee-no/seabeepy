    i.e. the domain shall be a geometry of type grid.

    It describes the mapping of grid posts (discrete point grid
    coverage) or grid cells (discrete surface coverage) to the values in
    the range set. The gml:startPoint is the index position of a point
    in the grid that is mapped to the first point in the range set (this
    is also the index position of the first grid post).  If the
    gml:startPoint property is omitted the gml:startPoint is assumed to
    be equal to the value of gml:low in the gml:Grid geometry.
    Subsequent points in the mapping are determined by the value of the
    gml:sequenceRule.
